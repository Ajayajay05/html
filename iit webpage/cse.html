         Global excellence and local relevance in research, teaching, and technology development is the vision of the Department. The Department was started as the Computer Centre in 1973 with the acquisition of an IBM 370, perhaps the most powerful computer in India at that time. It offered M.Tech, M.S and PhD degree programmes. In 1983, the B.Tech degree programme was started.

         Today the Department has a vibrant student body numbering about 700. Over 60% are postgraduate, mostly supported by scholarships. The Department also offers several attractive industry-sponsored Fellowships for outstanding PhD scholars and liberally supports participation in top-ranking international conferences.

         The department has been funded by FIST program from DST, Govt. of India in 2002 and 2017. The Secure Systems Laboratory is funded by FIST program 2017.

         The report on the department activities presented by the Head of the Department at the Department Degree Distribution Program, 2019 is available here.

<h2>Message from Hod</h2>
      Welcome to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras. IIT Madras was ranked first amongst several other similar Research and Teaching institutions in Engineering in the 2016 and 2017 National Institute Ranking Framework established by the Ministry for Human Resources Development (MHRD), the Government of India. IIT Madras was ranked amongst the top 50 Asian Universities in the QS rankings 2018.
      The Department started as the Computer Centre in 1973 with the acquisition of an IBM 370 Computer. It presently offers B. Tech., dual-degree B.Tech./ M.Tech., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D. degree programmes. A dual-degree B.Tech/M.Tech. program in data science, open to all B.Tech. students of IIT Madras, has been started from Jan. 2018.

      The department has a vibrant student body numbering around 700 and faculty numbering nearly 30. About 60% of students are postgraduates, mostly supported by government of India scholarships and research projects. The Departments also offers several attractive industry- sponsored fellowships for outstanding Ph.D. scholars.

      The vision of the CSE Department is Global Excellence and Local Relevance in Research, teaching, and technology development in Computer Science and Engineering. In pursuit of this vision, the Department is actively engaged in research activities in various research areas.

      The Department’s research activities have been funded by several Government organizations such as Department of Science & Technology (DST), Ministry Of Electronics & Information Technology (MeiTY), and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO); and by several industries including Accenture, Amazon, Google, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Tata Power Corporation. Several of our alumni hold important positions in the industry and academia worldwide. Students have been recently placed, both in India and abroad, in several leading national and international companies including Apple, Flipkart, Goldman Sachs, Google, IBM, Juniper, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal, Samsung, Uber, and Visa. Many Ph.D. graduates are serving as faculty members, both in India and abroad, in reputed educational institutions such as Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, IIT Guwahati, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Jodhpur, IIT Kanpur, IIT Tirupati, Iowa State University and National University of Singapore. According to a Brown University study reported in May 2014, IIT Madras was the fifth largest contributor of faculty members to Computer Science Programmes in U.S universities including MIT, Stanford and Yale.
